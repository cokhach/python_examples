n = int(input('enter a number : '))
print(*range(1, n+1), sep='-')
print(*(i for i in range(1, n+1)), sep='+')
print(*range(n))

The * operator is used for sequence unpacking. 
It can take any iterable and pass unpacked components
to a feeder function, in this case print. It works for
print as this specific function can take an arbitrary
number of arguments, e.g. try print(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, sep='').
It will not, in contrast, work with list, which requires only one argument.
